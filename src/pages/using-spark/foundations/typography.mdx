# Typography

Typography is the physical appearance of written
text. It includes the sizes, line heights,
colors, and fonts that are used.

### Usage

Typography settings are foundational to Spark
components and will also be foundational to
your application. See each variant below for
specific usage.

## Variants

### Page Title

The Page Title is used on primary pages that
contain multiple jumping off points as well as
core product features and flows. It should
only be used once at the top of the main content
of a page. Page Title should only be used with
Display One and Display Two.
